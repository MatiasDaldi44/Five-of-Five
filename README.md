# Project-1 (5ofFive)
# Slogan: Find five places to stay in 5 easy steps!
# Description: The 5ofFive project started as an idea to list our five cheap places to stay and five cheap places to eat for a city you would like to visit. Due to difficulties with a restuarunt API we had to limit our functionality to just providing the user the five cheapest places to stay for the city they request and giving them a map of where it is located.
# Our APIs: Hotels API, Custom Search API, and Google Maps API.
# How to use: Step 1) Enter the city you would like to visit. Step 2) Decide which of the five locations you would like stay at. Step 3) View the map to see if its located in an area you would like to be in. Step 4) Book your stay by clicking 'Book Now' and clicking the link of the website you would prefer to book though. Step 5) Enjoy your stay!
